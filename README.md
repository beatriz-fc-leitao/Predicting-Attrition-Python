# 💼 Python: Predicting Employee Attrition
	  
## Introduction
**👩🏻‍💼 THE SITUATION** 

Employee attrition is a costly event for any company, not only does it imply lost productivity, but there are also costs involved in recruiting and training new personnel. Moreover, high employee turnover can create a burden on the remaining staff that are left to pick up the workload, affecting motivation and morale.

**✏️ THE OBJECTIVE**

Suppose a large company is facing increased reates of employee attrition and hired me to try to tackle this issue. 

The main objectives of this project are:
- Explore the data to gain insights on who is most likely to quit and understand risk factors that may be related to attrition.
- Create a binary classification model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company or not. 
- With insights from data exploration and the predictions from the model, propose recommendations to the company for reducing their attrition rate.
