# 💼 Python: Predicting Employee Attrition
	  
## Introduction
**👩🏻‍💼 THE SITUATION** 

Employee attrition is a costly event for any company, not only does it imply lost productivity, but there are also costs involved in recruiting and training new personnel. Moreover, high employee turnover can create a burden on the remaining staff that are left to pick up the workload, affecting motivation and morale.

**✏️ THE OBJECTIVE**

Suppose a large company is facing increased reates of employee attrition and hired me to try to tackle this issue. 

The main objectives of this project are:
- Explore the data to gain insights on who is most likely to quit and understand risk factors that may be related to attrition.
- Create a binary classification model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company or not. 
- With insights from data exploration and the predictions from the model, propose recommendations to the company for reducing their attrition rate.

**🛠 THE TOOLS**

This project was conducted in Python using mainly Numpy, Pandas, and Sklearn.

**📊 THE DATASET**

The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle as it was used for a previous Kaggle competition. it can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e3/data).
		
## Project
**🗄 The final output**
- You can find the notebook with all the data exploration and the final classification model [here](https://github.com/beatriz-fc-leitao/Predicting-Attrition-Python/blob/main/employee_attrition.ipynb).
- You can find an executive report summarizing the project from start to end, including data exploration and all models attempted [here](https://github.com/beatriz-fc-leitao/Predicting-Attrition-Python/blob/main/Predicting%20Employee%20Attrition.pdf).

## 📚 Conclusion
**💡 Summary of Key Findings**

- The bianry classification model can predict whether someone will quit or not in about 80% of cases. 
- Some of the top risk factors of attrition are being a Sales Representative, being a Sales Executive, having 3 years or less at the company, being under 31 years old, having no stock options, and working overtime.

**📝 Summary of Business Recommendations**

To reduce attrition rates, the company could:
- Release a survey sent to staff in sales roles to understand whihc factors they do not like about their job and to understand how these could be limited to a minimum.
- Set up a long term career development plan for sales representatives to increase their commitment to the organization.
- Set up monthly check-ins with recent hires prior to their 3 year work anniversaries to better understand their mental health and how they have been coping with their role.
- Consider offering more stock options, especially to younger employees to encourage them to remain motivated to stay at the company in the long-term.
